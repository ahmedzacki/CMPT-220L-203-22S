##In this doc, I will explain my Binary Search Tree implementaiton project

  In my project, I have 3 files. A Binary Search tree class, node class, and the main function class. 
  
  #in my Main function:
  
  First, I have created an instance of my binary search tree and set the root equal to null, because we want to start it empty. 
  
  Then I have created my insertion function, so that I will able to push in element into the tree. My insertion function takes an int value.
